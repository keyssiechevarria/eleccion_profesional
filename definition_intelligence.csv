intelligence,definition
Linguistic intelligence,"Ability to use words effectively, either orally (for example, as a storyteller, speaker, or politician) or in writing (poets, playwrights, editors, journalists). This intelligence includes the ability to handle syntax or the structure of language, phonology or the sounds of language, semantics or the meanings of words, and pragmatic dimensions or practical uses of language. Some of these uses are rhetoric (use of language to convince others to perform a certain action), mnemonics (use of language to remember information), explanation (use of language to inform), and metalanguage (use of language to speak one's own language)."
mathematical intelligence,"Ability to use numbers effectively (mathematicians, accountants, statisticians) and to reason well (scientists, computer programmers, logic specialists). This intelligence includes sensitivity to logical patterns and relationships, statements and propositions (if...then, cause-and-effect), functions, and other related abstractions. The processes used in logical-mathematical intelligence include: categorization, classification, deduction, generalization, calculation and hypothesis testing."
Spatial intelligence,"Ability to perceive the visuospatial world accurately (for example, as a hunter, escort or guide) and to carry out transformations based on those perceptions (interior designers, architects, artists, inventors). This intelligence involves sensitivity to color, lines, shape, space and the relationships between these elements. It includes the ability to visualize, to graphically represent visual or spatial ideas, and to orient oneself correctly in a spatial matrix."
Body intelligence,"Mastery of one's own body to express ideas and feelings (actors, mimes, athletes or dancers), and ease of using one's hands in the creation or transformation of objects (craftsmen, sculptors, mechanics, surgeons). This intelligence includes specific physical abilities, such as coordination, balance, dexterity, strength, flexibility and speed, as well as proprioceptive, tactile and haptic abilities."
Musical intelligence,"Ability to perceive (as a music fan), discriminate (music critics), transform (composers) and express (performers) musical forms. This intelligence includes sensitivity to the rhythm, pitch or melody, and timbre or color of a piece of music. Music can be understood from a figurative or “top-down” (global, intuitive), formal or “bottom-up” (analytical, technical) perspective, or both."
Interpersonal intelligence,"Ability to perceive and distinguish the moods, intentions, motivations and feelings of other people. It may include sensitivity to facial expressions, voices, and gestures; the ability to distinguish between numerous types of interpersonal signals, and to respond effectively and pragmatically to those signals (for example, influencing a group of people to take a certain action)."
Intrapersonal intelligence,"Self-knowledge and the ability to act on that knowledge. This intelligence includes an accurate image of oneself (one's strengths and limitations), awareness of one's moods, intentions, motivations, temperaments, and inner desires, and the capacity for self-discipline, self-understanding, and self-esteem."
